            <p>As an employee in a company or organization, there will be instances when you will be tasked to attend a seminar, training, conference, etc. Usually those conventions are closely related to what the company organization does on a daily or how the company or organization can improve on other aspects. These conventions are important since new information, techniques, or strategies will be taught and discussed helping the company grow even more. Sometimes, it can also be required by the law that a representative of a company is sent to attend conventions.</p>
