            <p> History</p>
            Basically, the conference report summarizes the entirety of the conference. It explains the main idea of what the speaker has discussed and basically all the other activities that occurred on the said conference. It is usually required to submit a conference report almost immediately after the attendee reports back to work in order to preserve the information he/she was able to learn. In addition to that, it is also distributed to other employees especially when there is a need for immediate action to what has been discussed in the conference.

            <h2>Mission</h2>

            <p>We’re on the ground worldwide in search of well-crafted, single-origin loose leaf teas to share with our North American community. We’re pushing limits in new tea frontiers with our blends. We want it to be as easy as possible to discover, explore and feel better through tea.</p>

            <h2>Past Speakers</h2>

            <p>Brandon Farbstein’s bio is short, it’s interesting, and it opens with information that highlights the attributes that set him apart from other speakers. It gets personal and draws the reader in. Personally, if I saw this bio in a conference program I would definitely make time in my schedule to attend this presentation. 

               “At just 20, Brandon Farbstein has already made a name for himself worldwide as a sought-after speaker and prominent Gen Z activist. Diagnosed with a rare form of dwarfism at the age of 2, Brandon stands at 3’9” – making his life’s journey full of adversity, strength, and impact. After feeling invisible and without a purpose for the first 15 years of his life, he discovered his calling on the TEDx stage, and suddenly realized his life’s meaning: to change the lens through which people see their world.  In just three years of speaking, over five million people across the globe have been inspired by Brandon; and his work continues to touch audiences from every walk of life.”</p>
